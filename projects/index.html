        <li>- Implemented the NEAT algorithm using the JAX framework for tensorized representation and parallel computation.</li>
        <li>- Achieved 10-100x speedup compared to Python-NEAT.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was responsible for simplifying the design of the NEAT algorithm, conducting comprehensive
        experimental research, and testing its performance against other algorithms. I also fine-tuned
        the parameters to enhance the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

      <h2>Humanoid Pruning Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a visualization of a humanoid model with only 3,000 parameters. Despite the reduction
        in parameters, the pruned model performs similarly to the original model, which has 100,000
        parameters. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the INCEPT algorithm in reducing model
        complexity while maintaining high performance.

      <h2>PPO Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance on CARLA Platform</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I implemented PPO for real-time obstacle avoidance on the CARLA simulation platform,
        a popular platform for autonomous driving research. The goal was to train an agent to navigate a complex
        environment while avoiding obstacles in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a video showing the PPO agent navigating the CARLA platform, avoiding obstacles, and successfully
        reaching its navigation point.

      <h2>INCEPT on Genesis Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I am working on migrating the INCEPT algorithm to the Genesis platform, which will allow us
        to conduct extensive experimentation and further evaluate the algorithm's performance across different
        robotic tasks.
