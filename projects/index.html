        <li>- Implemented the NEAT algorithm using the JAX framework for tensorized representation and parallel computation.</li>
        <li>- Achieved 10-100x speedup compared to Python-NEAT.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was responsible for simplifying the design of the NEAT algorithm, conducting comprehensive
        experimental research, and testing its performance against other algorithms. I also fine-tuned
        the parameters to enhance the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

        In this project, I was responsible for optimizing the algorithm design and tuning hyperparameters,
        which significantly improved TensorNEAT's performance in the Walker2D task. My work contributed
        to achieving second place in the competition.

    <!-- INCEPT Algorithm Section -->

      <h2>INCEPT Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The INCEPT algorithm was independently designed by me with the goal of achieving high pruning
        rates while maintaining model performance. The algorithm has demonstrated impressive results,
        achieving up to a 97% pruning rate on the Humanoid and several MuJoCo tasks without sacrificing
        the accuracy of the model. This is a significant breakthrough in the field of neural network
        pruning, as it outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of training cost, model
        accuracy, and pruning rate. The INCEPT algorithm is currently being prepared for submission to
        Nature Machine Intelligence, where we hope to share our findings with the broader research community.
      </p>

      <h3>Humanoid Pruning Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a visualization of a humanoid model with only 3,000 parameters. Despite the reduction
        in parameters, the pruned model performs similarly to the original model, which has 100,000
        parameters. This is a testament to the effectiveness of the INCEPT algorithm in reducing model
        complexity while maintaining high performance.

      <h3>Walker2D Network Pruning Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        Below is the visualization of the Walker2D model after pruning. The image clearly shows the network's
        connection pattern post-pruning, where the critical connections are maintained while the non-essential
        ones are removed. This pruning process not only optimizes the network but also makes it more interpretable.

      <h2>PPO Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance on CARLA Platform</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I implemented PPO for real-time obstacle avoidance on the CARLA simulation platform,
        a popular platform for autonomous driving research. The goal was to train an agent to navigate a complex
        environment while avoiding obstacles in real time. This project was part of a course project, and I was
        responsible for implementing the PPO algorithm, tuning the hyperparameters, and optimizing the training process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a video showing the PPO agent navigating the CARLA platform, avoiding obstacles, and successfully
        reaching its navigation point.

      <p>
        Currently, I am working on migrating the INCEPT algorithm to the Genesis platform, which will allow us
        to conduct extensive experimentation and further evaluate the algorithm's performance across different
        robotic tasks.
