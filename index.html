        <p>
            My name is Mengfei Zhao, a third-year student majoring in Intelligent Science within 
            the Computer Science and Engineering Department. My supervisor is Ran Cheng, an associate 
            professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I will be participating in the UCSD 2025 
            Spring Extension Program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am exploring the intersection of pruning and optimization in Reinforcement 
            Learning. After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. I am the 
            leader of the EMI NeuroEvolution subgroup, and my research fuels my desire to develop a 
            systematic understanding of problems and offer innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond AI, I am deeply intrigued by complex systems, mathematical logic, and philosophy. 
            My goal is to immerse myself in the pursuit of knowledge, continuously seeking to 
            understand the world in new ways. One of my favorite books is <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An 
            Eternal Golden Braid</em> — it beautifully intertwines these interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy connecting with others, drawing strength from meaningful relationships and 
            interactions. These connections enrich my life, providing both a sense of belonging and 
            a deeper understanding of the world around me.
